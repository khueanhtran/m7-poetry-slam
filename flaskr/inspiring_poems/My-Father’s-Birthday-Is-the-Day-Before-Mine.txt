
The last train pulses across the pane
and fireflies spark beside the tracks.
Acne’s red wing flames my face:
I can’t take back
this skin. In the other room,
a drugstore Timex synchronizes
with the faucet’s drip. If I squint,
the fireflies align their lives
to map the summer’s migraine
of flowers that were weeds.
You say, but I think
they’re just trying to survive —
