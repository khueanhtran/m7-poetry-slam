
It is pleasant, very pleasant, to sit at a wooden boothsurrounded by parrots, wheels, right-turning conch shells,the victory banner and the endless knot,the lotus, the treasure vase, the golden fishes—is this not so? Is it not pleasantto sip Tsingtao beer, or Zhujiang, or Yanjing,and tap your fingers on the bamboo mats?After we’ve drunk enough, there will be Buddhist Delight,Mongolian beef side dishes, a whole host of sauces,even some pizza and chicken wings if children are present,as well as the small ice-cream machine, lotus paste, pears,smiles and bows all around. It is pleasant, is it not,to linger outside the door that opens to the parking lotof this small strip mall beside this secondary roadand look upon the scattered cars all come to rest herelike boats in China, floating on a quiet evening tide.
